				<h2>Independent and Product-Agnostic</h2>
				<p>As a calculation engine, FinMason is product-agnostic. Our independence means that we don’t market additional investment products or vehicles with our analytics. Our focus is on delivering the investment analytics that (a) you need to build the best product and (b) that your users need to make the most informed decisions.</p>

		<h1>Why the API?</h1>
		<p>In order to compete and develop the best products for users, FinTech and WealthTech firms need to rapidly develop technology. Oftentimes, these products benefit from, or depend on, robust investment analytics. While building an in-house analytics system may be an option, old tech stacks, long dev times, high costs, and other factors can lead to enormous time and budget commitments.<br><br>

		Recognizing these obstacles, the FinMason API was built from the ground up to deliver world-class analytics to any firm developing FinTech or WealthTech quickly, flexibly, and at-scale. FinMason sources nearly every publicly-traded security, of every type, from around the world and does the heavy lifting of cleaning the data, validating the data, and running a full analysis on each and every security. The result goes well beyond standard investment analytics. Our engine can calculate an entire suite of highly insightful and understandable analytics on a full portfolio in less than 20 milliseconds.<br><br>

		With just a few lines of code, your firm could have access to robust analytics on millions of securities globally, enabling development to jump right to rapid prototyping, iterating on functionality, and A/B testing.<br><br>

Augment your offering with scenario analyses, allowing investors to see how their portfolios would perform given various potential market conditions. Calculate a risk score for their portfolios, offering them perspective on their current investment strategies. Show them the factor sensitivities that their portfolios are exposed to, providing a more granular and specific view of the risk in their portfolios than asset-class breakdowns.</p>
